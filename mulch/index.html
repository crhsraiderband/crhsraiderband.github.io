    <h3>You can purchase mulch, donate cash, or both</h3>
    <p>Don't need mulch because you aren't local? Choose "No Mulch, I'll be making a donation". If you need just a few bags and want it delivered, you can add a donation to meet the delivery minimum of $40. </p>

    <h3>Thank you for your support!</h3>
    <p>Whether you are a friend, family member, co-worker, or alumni of the program, the 200 member Cedar Ridge Raider Band and Color Guard cannot exist and compete at this level without your support. All proceeds go toward supporting operating expenses of the band which include purchasing our show music, show design, props, transportation, uniforms, and meals. Thank you for your generosity and support! </p>
