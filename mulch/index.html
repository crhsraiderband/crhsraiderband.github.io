    <h3>Delivery</h3>

    <h3>Pickup</h3>

    <h3>Thank you for your support!</h3>
    <p>Whether you are a friend, family member, co-worker, or alumni of the program, the 220 member Cedar Ridge Raider Band and Color Guard cannot exist and compete at this level without your support. All proceeds go toward supporting operating expenses of the band which include purchasing our show music, show design, props, transportation, uniforms, and meals. We are also funding a new semi-trailer later this year for transporting our equipment. Thank you for your generosity and support! </p>
